## Introduction

The CVRP Optimization Spring Boot Application is a project designed to solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using optimization techniques. The application is built with Spring Boot, making it easy to integrate and deploy. CVRP is a classic problem in vehicle routing where a fleet of vehicles is assigned to deliver goods to a set of customers while optimizing routes and satisfying capacity constraints.
Features

    CVRP Solver: Utilizes optimization algorithms to solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem.
    Spring Boot: Built on the Spring Boot framework, providing a robust and scalable foundation.
    RESTful API: Exposes endpoints for interacting with the CVRP solver and retrieving optimization results.
    Customizable: Configurable parameters for the CVRP solver to adapt to different scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed before running the application:

    Java Development Kit (JDK)
    Maven

## Getting Started

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cvrp-optimization-spring-boot.git

## Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd cvrp-optimization-spring-boot

## Build the project:

bash

mvn clean install

Run the application:

bash

    java -jar target/cvrp-optimization-spring-boot.jar

The application will start, and you can access it at http://localhost:8080.
Configuration

Adjust the application configuration in the application.properties file to suit your needs. Specify parameters such as optimization algorithms, solver settings, and API configurations.

properties

## Sample configuration properties
app.solver.algorithm=genetic
app.solver.population-size=100
app.solver.generations=500

Usage

Describe how users can interact with and use your application. Include examples of API requests, payload formats, and expected responses.
API Endpoints

    POST /optimize: Submit a CVRP instance for optimization.

    Example Request:

    bash

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/optimize -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"customers": [{"id": 1, "demand": 5, "location": {"lat": 35.123, "lon": -90.456}}, {"id": 2, "demand": 8, "location": {"lat": 35.456, "lon": -90.789}}], "vehicles": [{"capacity": 20, "startLocation": {"lat": 35.789, "lon": -90.123}}]}'

## Example Response:

json

    {
      "routes": [
        {"vehicleId": 1, "customerIds": [2, 1], "totalDistance": 35.67},
        {"vehicleId": 2, "customerIds": [3], "totalDistance": 12.45}
      ],
      "totalDistance": 48.12
    }
